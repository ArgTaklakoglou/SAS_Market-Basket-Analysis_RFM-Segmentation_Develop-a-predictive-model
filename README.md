# SAS_Market-Basket-Analysis_RFM-Segmentation_Develop-a-predictive-model

### In this assignment the goal is to impement a Market Basket Analysis for Case 1, an Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Segmentation for Case 2 and a predictive model for Case 3.

##### Case 1:
Buy-books-on-line.com is an on line store that sells books about science and information 
technology. The store is very well known in the academic community so a lot of its customers 
are university professors and also librarians at universities buying on behalf of their 
institutions. A very popular category of the books that the store sells is that related to 
“Business Analytics”. In this category the store has a list of 56 books such as “Credit Risk 
Analytics”, “Marketing Analytics”, “Analytics at Work” etc. The past year 1,896 customers 
have bought at least one book that belongs to the “Business Analytics” category i.e. at least 
one of the 56 books.

You are hired as an analyst by the on-line store to aid the analytics department in this market 
basket analysis initiative. After the data analysis you should write a report to the analytics 
team of the company (technical people) to explain them what you did, which method you 
used, how it works and what were your results. As already said the report should contain an 
executive summary in a business format. Use as minimum support level the 0.05 and as 
minimum confidence level the 0.1. Also set the maximum number of items in a rule equal to 
3 (three) (in the interface this option is referred erroneously as minimum number of items in 
a rule). Save the rules table in the CASUSER library with the title MBA_Results. In the main 
body of the report you should answer the questions are required in 'Assignment Description - Viya' pdf

##### Case 2:
Sports-OnLine.com is an on line retailer that sells sports clothes and shoes and it is operating 
in the market since October 2001. On January 2007, after six year of operation, the 
management team of the store wants to exploit the electronic data captured the previous 
years to better understand the market. After a meeting with the marketing department, it 
was decided that a customer segmentation analysis should be performed and, based on the 
available data, a Recency Frequency Monetary (RFM) analysis would be the most suitable 
technique for the desired objective.

You are hired as the Marketing Analytics consultant to perform the RFM segmentation with 
the machine learning software SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning in SAS Viya. Do 
the clustering of the customers and the profiling of the segments created. Name the segments 
(e.g. churners, good customers, bad customers, first time customers etc) and describe briefly 
what marketing actions are appropriate for each segment (e.g. customer reactivation 
program, contact customers for feedback, cross sell activities, special promotions etc) and 
why.

##### Case 3:
This case study refers to a fictitious insurance organization - XYZ – and more specifically to its 
marketing department that is currently organizing a targeted campaign to identify segments 
of customers who are likely to purchase a variable annuity (an insurance product). A variable 
annuity is a contract with an insurance company that includes investments you choose and a 
fixed insurance component. It allows you to receive monthly income payments that are 
guaranteed for the rest of your life, which makes them a popular choice for people afraid of 
running out of money in retirement (so it is designed to provide retirement income). Penalties 
can be incurred for early withdrawals.
As it can be understood the organization cannot contact all the customers in its database to 
promote the new product because this won’t prove profitable since a solicitation has a cost. 
So the organization must decide who to contact from the data base next year and this will 
depend on how much likely those customers will respond positively with a purchase i.e. how 
much likely is that they will purchase or not the insurance product.In order to gather data to 
develop the model the organization approached this year a sample of its customers and more 
specifically 30,129 and promoted the insurance product using telephone solicitations, 
personal contacts and offering of advertising material and gifts to each one of them and 
recorded whether the solicited customers replied positively to the purchase of the insurance
product. For each customer 47 characteristics that represented other product usage and
demographics were available.  

You are hired as a machine learning engineer to aid the insurance organization develop a 
model that will predict whether a customer will purchase the insurance product or not if s/he 
is solicited. The model should be built from the above mentioned data set. After the model is 
developed by using the historical data (this year’s data), it can be applied to the rest of the 
customer’s database next year to predict whether the rest of the customers will buy the 
product or not. The ID’s of the members that are more likely to purchase the insurance 
product will be directed to the marketing department for solicitation.
